I create a boxplot that highlights the outliers, I have to wrote a code. 
Boxplots are a measure of how well distributed is the data in a data set. It divides the data set into three quartiles. This graph represents the minimum, maximum, median, first quartile and third quartile in the data set.

Box Plot - in this image we can see the outliers red and are way out of the box

Bar Chart
A bar chart is used for summarizing a set of categorical data. In bar chart, the data is shown through rectangular bars having the length of the bar proportional to the value of the variable. In R, we can create a bar chart to visualize the data in an efficient manner.
